“We have an Account from Worcester, by Letters dated the 11th Instant, that the Election for Members for that City has been attended with warm and even violent Disputes; the Candidates were, Mr. Vernon, the late Member, Mr. Winford, who formerly represented the City of Hereford, and Mr. Tracey, Member heretofore for Tewkesbury. The Poll continued for five Days, when the returning Officer shut the Books, and declared Mr. Vernon and Mr. Winford duly elected. It is said that seventy two who claimed to have Votes, and were rejected, will bring their separate Actions against the returning Officer, against whom it is also said Mr. Tracey will petition, in order to establish his own Right; but as this Affair will be canvass’d in another Place we shall not presume at this Time to enter into farther Particulars, which however are not of a Nature to remain long a Secret from the Publick.”

“Worcester Election.  
  
A Petition of Robert Tracy Esquire was presented to the House, and read; setting forth, That Thomas Vernon Esquire, Thomas Geers Winford Esquire, and the Petitioner, having, on Wednesday the First Day of July 1747, been nominated Candidates to serve as Members in this present Parliament for the City of Worcester, a Poll was then demanded, and proceeded upon in the Guildhall of the said City, in the Course of which the Contest was between the Petitioner and the said Mr. Winford, there being an undoubted Majority for the said Thomas Vernon Esquire: That Joseph Hundley, the Sheriff and Returning Officer of the said City, being determined in all Events, right or wrong, to return the said Mr. Winford, he, in the Course of the said Election, under colour of exercising his Judgment, refused the Votes of several Persons duly qualified, who offered to vote for the Petitioner, and at the same time admitted many Persons who were not Freemen, and others who had been made free after the Teste of the Writ, and even after the Election began, and great Numbers of other Persons who had no Right of voting, to poll for the said Mr. Winford; and that at the Adjournment of the Poll, on Monday the 6th Day of July, there were great Numbers of Freemen who had not voted at the said Election, and who intended to vote for the Petitioner, whereby there would have been a very great Majority in favour of the Petitioner; of which the said Sheriff being informed, he, in order to deprive them of an Opportunity of being polled, purposely delayed opening the Poll on Tuesday the 7th Day of July, till near Eleven in the Morning; and after the Poll had been kept open about an Hour, on Notice being brought [426] into Court, that a great Number of Voters for the Petitioner were come, and coming, into the City, the said Sheriff, being determined to make a Return without observing so much as the Form of going through the Poll, at about a Quarter of an Hour after Twelve of the Clock, by the Advice and at the Influence of William Bund, the Deputy Town-Clerk, Robert Yarranton, One of the Chamberlains, and Thomas Wood, One of the Justices of the said City, and of Thomas Giles, a Clergyman, and others in the Interest of the said Mr. Winford, in Defiance of Law and Justice, in breach of an express Agreement signed by all the Candidates, and contrary to the Consent and express Protest of the Petitioner, and a great Number of the Freemen of the said City, who had not polled, and even while One of the Freemen was actually taking the Oaths in order to poll, and while a great Number of other Freemen were in Court ready and waiting to be polled for the Petitioner, in a most illegal and arbitrary Manner permitted the said William Bund to snatch up the Poll-Books, and declare the Poll was closed; and that thereupon the Petitioner, and several of the Freemen of the said City, who had a Right to poll, demanded of the said Joseph Hundley to open the Books, and permit their Poll to be taken; which he refused to do; and in an arbitrary Manner, without casting up the Clerks Books, declared that the Numbers on the Poll for the said Mr. Winford were 1074; and for the Petitioner only 1024; and that the said Mr. Winford was duly elected; and that, while this was doing, upwards of Seventy Freemen, who had an undoubted Right to vote, and who had not voted before at the said Election, gave their Votes in Court, at the usual Place of voting, for the Petitioner; which Votes were taken down in a publick Manner, while the Sheriff was sitting in Court, and in the Presence of the Under-Sheriff, by John Thornoloe and Nicholas Taylor, Two of the Clerks appointed to attend the Election on the Part of the Petitioner; and the said John Thorneloe [sic] immediately produced the List thereof to the said Sheriff in Court (the Court not being the adjourned) whereby it appeared, that the Petitioner had on the Poll a Majority of upwards of 20 Votes more than the said Mr. Winford; immediately after which, several other Freemen, who had a Right to vote, and had not before voted, went up to the said Sheriff then sitting in Court, and likewise demanded to have their Votes taken; and that, had the Sheriff kept the Poll open as he ought to have done, the Petitioner would have polled many more Votes: That by Threats, Bribery, and other corrupt and illegal Practices, several of the Freemen of the said City were prevented from voting for the Petitioner, and many others were prevailed upon to vote for the said Mr. Winford; and that the said Sheriff hath since unduly returned the said Mr. Winford as One of the Citizens to serve in this present Parliament for the said City, in manifest Prejudice to the Petitioner, and in Violation of the Rights of the said City: And therefore praying the House to take the Premises into Consideration; and to do therein as to the House shall seem meet.

A Petition of the several Freemen of the City of Worcester, whose Names are thereunto subscribed, in behalf of themselves, and several other Freemen of the said City, was presented to the House, and read; setting forth, That the Right of electing Citizens to represent the said City in Parliament is in the Freemen of the said City claiming their Freedom by Birth or Servitude; and that the Mayor and Common-Council of the said City, in whom the Power of admitting Persons to their Freedom is vested, have, in several Instances, more particularly with a View to the last general Election of Citizens to represent the said City in parliament, abused their Trust, by admitting great Numbers of Persons into the Freedom of the said City, called honorary Freemen, who had no previous Right thereto by Birth or Servitude, or ever exercised any Trade, or contributed to the Taxes, or bore any Offices in the said City, or made any other Use of their Freedom but the attempting to out-vote the Majority of the legal Freemen in the Choice of Citizens to represent the said City in Parliament: That Thomas Geers Winford, Thomas Vernon, and Robert Tracy Esquires, being, at the last general Election, nominated Candidates to serve as Members in this present Parliament for the said City, a Poll was demanded; during which, several of the Common-Council of the said City publickly declared, that, if the Hundred honorary Freemen they had then lately made would not carry the said Mr. Winford’s Election, they would make Five hundred; and, if that would not do, Five thousand more such Freemen against another Election; and that they have accordingly since proceeded to make a considerable Number more of such honorary Freemen, and that, in order to give the said Mr. Winford the Appearance of a great Majority at the Beginning of the Poll, the Voters for him were, during the Three First Days of the Poll, conveyed in great Numbers into the upper Rooms of the Guildhall of the said City, and from thence brought down to the Bar by a Back-door to poll; whereas none of the Freemen, who were willing to vote for the said Mr. Tracy, were permitted to come to vote, but the publick front Door of the Hall, through the Street; where several of them were insulted by a Mob of Persons in the Interest of the said Mr. Winford, who, by Force and Violence, prevented many of the said Freemen from polling at the said Election for the said Mr. Tracy: And complaining of the partial and illegal Proceedings of Joseph Hundley, the Sheriff and Returning Officer of the said City, in the Course of the said Election; and that the Poll was closed in an arbitrary Manner, contrary to the Consent and express Protest of several of the Petitioners, and a great Number of the other Freemen of the said City who had not polled, and even while One of the Freemen was actually taking the Oaths in order to poll, and while a great Number of other Freemen were in Court ready and waiting to be polled for the said Robert Tracy; and that the said Joseph Hundley, in an arbitrary Manner, without casting up the Clerks Books, declared, that the said Mr. Winford was duly elected; And alleging, That the said Robert Tracy had on the Poll a Majority of upwards of Twenty Votes more than the said Mr. Winford; and that, had the Sheriff kept the Poll open as he ought to have done, the said Robert Tracy would have polled many more Votes: That by Threats, Bribery, and other corrupt and illegal Practices, several of the Freemen of the said City were prevented from voting for the said Robert Tracy Esquire: and many others were, by the like Means, prevailed upon to vote for the said Mr. Winford: and that the said Sheriff hath since unduly returned the said Mr. Winford as One of the Citizens to serve in this present Parliament for the said City: And further setting forth, That several of the Petitioners, being thus deprived, by the Injustice of their Returning Officer, of their Franchise of voting at the said Election, and they, and the rest of the Petitioners, being thereby prevented from being represented in Parliament by Members of their own chusing [sic], think themselves obliged to apply to this House for such Redress to themselves as may be agreeable to the Nature of their Case; and for such Punishment to be inflicted on the said Joseph Hundley, and his Accomplices, as the Heinousness of the Offence, and the Danger of the Example, demands: And therefore praying the House to take the premises into Consideration; and to do therein as to the House shall seem meet.   
  
Ordered, That the Matter of the said Petition be heard, at the Bar of this House, at the same that the Matter of the Petition of Robert Tracy Esquire, complaining of an undue Election and Return for the said City, is appointed to be heard.

## Journal of the House of Commons (11 February 1747/8), vol. 25

[509] “The Order of the Day being read;  
  
The House proceeded to the Hearing of the Matter of the several Petitions complaining of an undue Election and Return for the City of Worcester:  
  
And the Counsel were called in:  
  
And the said Petitions were read:  
  
And the Standing Order of the House, made the 16th Day of January 1735, for restraining the Counsel at the Bar of this House, or before the Committee of Privileges and Elections, from offering Evidence touching the legality of Votes for Members to serve in Parliament for any County, Shire, City, Borough, Cinque-Port, or Place, contrary to the last Determination of the House of Commons, was also read:  
  
And Counsel for the Petitioners were heard:  
  
And they having stated the Right of electing Citizens to serve in parliament for the said City, to be in the Citizens of the said City, not receiving Alms, and admitted to their Freedom by Birth or Servitude, or by Redemption, in order to trade within the said City;  
  
And the Counsel for Thomas Geers Winford Esquire, the Sitting Member, petitioned against, having denied That to be the Right of Election; and having stated the Right to be in the Freemen of the said City, not receiving Alms;   
  
The Counsel for the Petitioners proposed to prove, That the Right of electing Citizens to serve in Parliament for the said City, was only in those Citizens, in whom they had stated that Right to be.   
  
And the original Charter, granted to the said City by King Henry the Third, dated the 17th of March, in the Eleventh Year of his Reign, was produced;  
  
And Part thereof was read, in order to prove, That all Persons who were not free of the Gild Mercatory of the said City, were restrained from exercising any Trade within the said City, or the Suburbs thereof, unless with the Consent of the Citizens of the said City.  
  
And several publick Books, belonging to the Corporation of the said City, having been produced;  
  
Several Entries in one of the said Books, of the Years 1743 and 1746 were read, in order to prove the manner of admitting Persons at that Time to the Freedom of the said City by Redemption:  
  
And an Entry, in another of the said Books, was read, in order to prove the manner of admitting Persons intitled to the Freedom of the said City by Servitude:  
  
And Part of the Report, made the 7th Day of February 1693, from the Committee of Privileges and Elections, to whom the Petition of Charles Cocks Esquire, complaining of an undue Election and Return for the said City, was referred, was also read, in order to shew [sic], That Evidence was then given, that Freedom by Birthright or Service were the two ways of being Freemen in the said City:  
  
And several Entries in a Book of the said Corporation, of the 15th Year of the Reign of King Charles the First, and of the Years 1643 and 1644, were also read, in order to prove, in what Manner, and under what Restrictions, Persons were then admitted honorary Freemen of the said City:  
  
And an Entry in another Book of the said Corporation, of the Year 1735, was also read, in order to prove, That the Manner of admitting honorary Freemen, at that Time, varied from the Manner in which such Freemen had been admitted to the said Fifteenth year of the Reign of King Charles the First, and in the said Years 1643 and 1644:  
  
And the Counsel for the Petitioners having proposed to read several other Entries in the same Book, subsequent to the Year 1735, to the same Purpose;  
  
The Counsel for the said Sitting Member admitted, That those Entries were made in the manner stated by the Counsel for the Petitioners.  
  
Then the Counsel for the Petitioners examined a Witness, in order to prove, That no Entries of the Admission of honorary Freemen appear in the Books of the said Corporation, before the Year 1639.  
  
Then and Entry in another Book of the said Corporation, dated in the Second Year of the Reign of King Charles the First, was read, in order to prove, in what manner Persons were then admitted of the Freedom of the said City by Composition.  
  
And the Counsel for the Petitioners having gone through their Evidence, as to the Right of Election;  
  
The Counsel for the said Sitting Member were heard, in Support of their State of the Right of Election:  
  
[510] And they examined a Witness, in order to prove, That all Freemen of the said City had a Right to vote in Elections as Citizens to serve in Parliament for the said City.  
  
And the Counsel for the Petitioners having been heard by way of Reply;  
  
The Counsel on both Sides were directed to withdraw.  
  
A Motion was made, and the Question being proposed, [“]That the Right of Election of Citizens to serve in Parliament for the City of Worcester, is in the Citizens of the said City, not receiving Alms, and admitted to their Freedom by Birth or Servitude, or by Redemption, in order to trade within the said City;” [note: this is a closing quote; there is no opening quote]  
  
An Amendment was proposed to be made to the Question, by leaving out the Words “in order to trade within the said City;”  
  
And the Question being put, That the Words, proposed to be left out, stand Part of the Question;  
  
The House divided.  
  
The Yeas went forth.  
  
Tellers for the Yeas, 	{Sir John Rushout,}	148

Tellers of the Noes,	{Sir James Dashwood,}	83  
	{Mr. Prowse:              }  
  
So it was resolved in the Affirmative.  
  
Then the main Question being put, That the Right of Election of Citizens to serve in Parliament for the City of Worcester, is in the Citizens of the said City, not receiving Alms, and admitted to their Freedom by Birth or Servitude, or by Redemption, in order to trade within the said City;  
  
The House divided.

So it was resolved in the Affirmative.  
  
Then the Counsel on both Sides being called in; and Mr. Speaker having acquainted them with the said Resolution;  
  
They were directed to withdraw.  
  
Then the Sitting Member, petitioned against, standing up in his Place, acquainted the House, That the House having come to the said Resolution, he could not make out a Majority of Votes; and therefore he would give the House no further Trouble.   
  
And then he withdrew.  
  
A Motion being made, and the Question being put, That Thomas Geers Winford Esquire is duly elected a Citizen to serve in this present Parliament for the City of Worcester;  
  
It passed in the Negative.  
  
Resolved, That Robert Tracy Esquire is duly elected a Citizen to serve in this present Parliament for the City of Worcester.  
  
Ordered, That the Clerk of the Crown do attend this House To-morrow Morning, to amend the Return for the City of Worcester, by rasing [sic] out the Name of Thomas Geers Winford Esquire, and inserting the Name of Robert Tracy Esquire, instead thereof.”

“1748. On the Worcester petition 11th Feb. 1747 [1748]….  
In the Year 1634 it appeared on the books that two persons were admitted to their freedom per redemptionem or purchase. In the year 1639 Lord Windsor was admitted as an honorary freeman, and ever since that time honorary freeman [sic] and those by purchase had been constantly admitted, and in 1746 they made 100 free. Lord Windsor promised upon his honor not to claim the exemption of toll but to pay like a foreigner. Not the least evidence that any honorary freeman’s vote had ever been objected to. Mr. [Nicholas] Fazakerly and Mr. [Randle] Wilbraham urged that a bor. by prescription of common right may make as many free as they think fit; that these honourary freemen are in possession of their franchise, and cannot legally be ousted, unless some resolution of the house, or some law, usage, or custom can be proved to restrain or take away that common right. Sir D. Bootle maintained the same to be law and that [312] the house, in their judicial capacity, could not alter it, but that if the power has been abused the legislature may by a bill restrain such abuses for the future. The house, notwithstanding, set aside the right of honorary freemen 138 to 77 …..”

For spotless honour paves they gen’rous way,  
And truth untainted glares in all you say.  
Oh! Form’d to show that Britons freedom prize,    
Nor all her glories fled to kindred skies;  
Thy virtues, Tracy, shun the conquer’d bays,  
Tho’ fraught with radiance of heroic lays;  
Yet thy kind nature, pleasing smiles will lend,  
To chear [sic] the joys of thine engladden’d friend.  
And orient lustre float a-round they head:

And all ye graces, all your glories lend.

Which time shall see, and future poets sing.

Whose charms deserve immportal Virgil’s praise,

For providing the right of electing to be as stated by the petitioner, the original charter granted to this city by king Henry III. in the 11th year of his reign, was produced, whereby it appeared, that all persons who were not free of the mercatory of the said city, were restrained from exercising any trade within the same, or the suburbs thereof, unless with the consent of the citizens; and it was proved, that no entries of the admission of honorary freemen appear in the books of the said corporation, before the year 1639; and that afterwards, when any such were admitted, it was under several restrictions.  
  
Of the other side the sitting member endeavored to prove by one witness, that all freemen had a right to vote at elections of parliament-men for the said city; but this proof not being sufficient, and the custom of admitting honorary freemen having been so lately introduced, the house resolved, That the right of electing citizens to serve in parliament, for the city of Worcester is in the citizens of the said city, not receiving alms, and admitted to their freedom by birth or servitude, or by redemption in order to trade within the said city.  
  
Upon this the sitting member stood up in his place and acquainted the house, that according to this resolution, he could not make out a majority of vote, therefore he would give the house no farther trouble; whereupon Robert Tracy, Esq; was declared duly elected, and the return amended accordingly.”

“VERSES address’d to the Gentlemen of Worcester, who, in the Time of the late Rebellion, form’d an Association call’d The Constitution Club, and chose for their Motto  
BEEF AND LIBERTY.  
We hope the Merit of these Lines will attone [sic] for their being somewhat out of season, and the rather because they have been long mislay’d.  
  
LONG had my lyre forgot the joyful strain,   
A votive gift in Phœbus’ sacred fane:  
But now resum’d, again I tune the strings,  
And Worcester’s praise ye Muse responding sings.  
  
Let willing slaves, in ev’ry foreign clime,   
Deem love of Liberty a daring crime;  
The sweets that bloom on Albion’s happy plains  
Untasted, bless their desarts [sic], and their chains;  
In grov’ling numbers chaunt [sic] their servile lays,  
And fawn on tyrants, with polluted praise;  
  
A nobler theme my freeborn heart inspires,  
And who but knos to sing when Freedom fires!  
Subjects unshackled, and a patriot-king  
Claim the glad tribute which I proudly bring.  
  
From steril [sic] rocks, and everlasting snow,  
When Scotia pur’d, in swarms the savage foe  
To banish blessings in their wastes unknown,  
And make our lands as joyless as their own,  
By Mem’ry goaded, Indignation rose,  
Her eyes dart light’ning, and her bosom glows.  
‘Keep, keep, she cries, ye happy and ye brave,  
‘What bought with blood, your fore-fathers gave;  
‘The dread of tyrants, in ye field they drew!’  
Warm’d by the sound, all ardent you reply,  
’Still brave, still happy, tyrants we defy;  
‘Our fathers spirits in our bosom wake,  
‘And what to us they gave, our sons shall take.’  
One impulse mov’d ye, and one wish combin’d  
To blast whatever fraud or force design’d;  
To drive the foe o’er frozen hills again,  
Where Want and Winter share a gloomy reign.   
  
While some with trembling lips their fears confess’d  
And shook with all that fancy could suggest,  
Some, more insidious, bore a meaner part,  
And the sly question show’d the traytor’s [sic] heart;  
Some drop’d the mask, and own’d the broken vow,  
Nor fear of heav’n nor shame restrains them now;  
You, ‘midst a thousand faithless, faithful found.  
Start from the wicked and the weak, around,  
Raise the broad banner, and aloud proclaim  
The Briton’s birthright, and the Briton’s aim,  
Unknown to slaves that serve a tyrant-chief,  
To us familiar, LIBERTY and BEEF.  
  
Ye meanest reptiles, destitute of souls,  
Whom abject love of servitude controuls, [sic]  
Unworthy blessings which are Britain’s boast,  
Hence—cringe and starve in Gallia’s envy’d coast;  
There, tastleis [sic] freedom shall no longer tire,  
There, find the racks and gallies ye desire;  
There take the yoke, the slaves of tinsel state,  
And own your shame in boasting Lewis great;  
There soups and sallads shall your board supply,  
And the kind of priest absolve ye when ye die;  
Till then, around ye French dragoons shall range,  
Long to secure the blessings of your change.  
  
For you, who, still of glorious pride possess’d,  
The slaves in thought and deed alike detest,  
On whom fair Liberty, a dove-ey’d maid!  
Serenely smiles, by smiles again repaid;  
For you may heav’n, propitious to my pray’r,  
Reserve a better state, with gracious care!  
O! May the corn of Britain still supply  
Your board with bread, which foreign climes deny,  
Still may both Indies your rich banquet grace,  
And still the princely loin maintain its place;  
May this, amidst the dainties round it spread,  
With proud pre-eminence exalt its head:  
May this still nerve the Briton’s dreaded arm,  
When rude Rebellion sounds the rash alarm!  
This, lend him strength to blast the impious hand  
That dares but touch the ark of Britain’s land!  
But from light mirth I turn the solemn strain  
To heav’n nor heav’n shall humble vows disdain.   
  
Thou good supreme! the joy of worlds above,  
Whose service, freedom! and whose laws are love!  
O! keep my country from a tyrant free,  
Whene’er chastiz’d, chastiz’d alone by thee!  
Yet spare, O! spare the rod our crimes demand,   
And bid Repentance save a sinful land;  
Here still let Plenty all her wealth bestow,  
In fertile pastures let our oxen lowe;  
No captive’s sigh re-echo thro’ our street,  
But peace and joy in blest embraces meet;  
And, with these blessings, yet one more be giv’n,  
One more exalted, gratitude to heav’n.

“Worcester, August 8 1753.  
To the FREEMEN of this CITY.  
Gentlemen,   
As I had the Honour at the last General Election of being chosen one of your Representatives in Parliament, I flatter myself I have discharged my Trust to your Satisfaction in particular, and to the Approbation of every true Englishman, since it has been the invariable Rule of my Conduct, to shew the utmost Regard to our excellent Constitution in Church and State, as the only Means of preserving the present Royal Family upon the Throne, and pursuing the real Interest of my Country. And as I have been so fortunate, by applying to Parliament, to restore to you the Freedom of Election*, which was broaded by a notorious and extravagant Abuse of Power, you may be assured, that whilst I have the Honour of a Seat in Parliament for your City, I shall steadily pursue, with the like Assistance, and I make no Doubt with the utmost Success, those salutary Measures that may tend to reinstate you in all your antient Rights and Liberties, which will encourage Trade, employ the Poor, and restore your once flourishing City to its former Wealth and Prosperity. As the Dissolution of this Parliament is drawing near, I take the Liberty of offering myself a Candidate for the next General Election, and beg the Favour of your Votes and Interest, which will lay the highest Obligation upon, Gentlemen,   
Your most obedient humble Servant,  
ROBERT TRACY.  
  
*What is here meant, is the Creation of near 400 Honorary Freemen (99 whereof were made at one Chamber-meeting on the 25th of August 1746) on Purpose to give an undue Infuence to Elections in this City, and to destroy the Right of the poor Freemen to chuse their own Members.”
