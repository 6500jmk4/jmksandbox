I have designed this module to introduce you to historical network analysis using Gephi. The readings will present some of the general frameworks and theories of social network analysis and historical network analysis, but, I would like to emphasize that 1) they are not comprehensive and 2) they tend to emphasize early modern European networks, which is where my research interests tend to be focused. The Gephi section will provide a working knowledge of Gephi, a popular and (relatively) easy-to-use network analysis program. There are a number of tutorials on the internet, so instead of re-creating the wheel, I am assigning a few of these tutorials.

By the end of this module, you will

1.  Have a general knowledge of the basic theories of Social Network Analysis (SNA).
2.  Understand the limits and opportunities for using network analysis in historical contexts.
3.  Have a working knowledge of Gephi and its feature set.

For the Readings section, I would recommend approaching it in the order listed. They will give you a taste of the complexities of network analysis in history. In the Application section, you will need to complete tasks in the order listed.

## Gephi

### Before You Begin

Before I begin playing with a new program, I often like to get an overview of how it works by watching somebody use it on YouTube. Here’s a great video by Professor Jennifer Golbeck that will give you a sense of the Gephi interface as well as some of the features for analysis that are built into the program.https://www.youtube.com/embed/HJ4Hcq3YX4k

### Setup

1.  [Download](https://gephi.org/) Gephi.
2.  [Install](https://gephi.org/users/install/) Gephi.
3.  Download the [LesMiserables](https://gephi.org/datasets/LesMiserables.gexf) data set.

### Tutorials

1.  Complete the [Quick Start](https://gephi.org/tutorials/gephi-tutorial-quick_start.pdf) tutorial provided by Gephi.
2.  Complete Dr. Martin Grandjean’s “[Gephi – Introduction to Network Analysis and Visualization](http://www.martingrandjean.ch/gephi-introduction/).”
3.  Complete Dr. Paul Oldham’s “[Network Visualisation with Gephi](https://www.pauloldham.net/gephi_patent_network/).”

### Algorithms

While [playing with the layouts and the settings](https://gephi.org/users/tutorial-layouts/) within Gephi is a great way to get a feel for their differences, using Gephi in an analytical context requires understanding the algorithms behind the layouts.

#### Next Steps


*   [Historic Network Research](http://historicalnetworkresearch.org/)
*   Dr. Scott Weingart’s nine-part series, “[Networks Demystified](http://scottbot.net/tag/networks-demystified/)”
*   Scott, John, and Peter J. Carrington, eds. _The SAGE Handbook of Social Network Analysis_. SAGE, 2011.

#### Gephi Alternatives

Not surprisingly, there are a number of Gephi alternatives. I have included them below if you’re interested in comparing and contrasting them.

*   [Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org/)
*   [Pajek](http://mrvar.fdv.uni-lj.si/pajek/)
*   [VOSViewer](https://www.vosviewer.com/)

If you would like to experiment with some other techniques and programming frameworks for network analysis, I would recommend trying out these tutorials from the _Programming Historian_:
