## Introduction 
This Google Classrooms module introduces an important concept for the practice of history: the distinction between history and memory. To better understand this distinction, we are going to take a look at a few monuments and the historical circumstances of their creation (and sometimes destruction). 

## Learning Outcomes:
- Be able to distinguish between the practice of historical scholarship and the process of historical memory.
- Contextualize recent events in Charlottesville within a larger historical framework.
- Apply the concept of historical memory to controversies over Confederate monuments.
